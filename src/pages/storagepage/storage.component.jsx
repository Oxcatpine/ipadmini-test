        If you're trying to decide which of the options – 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB – is right for you, you need to think about how you plan to use your iPad Mini. If you already have a host of other gadgets, such as the standard size iPad or an iPhone, then the 16GB may be all you need for a sturdy, reliable, on-the-go tablet. The more you plan to do with your tablet, and the more apps you plan to download, the more storage you'll need.
